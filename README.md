This is a version of djbdns based on the main AUR djbdns package but
with the internic root nameservers replaced with OpenDNS servers
generated by http://wiki.opennicproject.org/ClosestT2Servers.  

This package also depends on runit instead of daemontools.

This means the dnsroots.global could stand to up updated from time to
time, so we will include a utility to update that in the future.
